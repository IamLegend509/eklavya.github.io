### Project Description

Kurma is a budget quadruped with a turtle-like frame.  
Your mission: teach it to walk—first in simulation, then in the real world.

1. **Policy Learning (PPO)**  
   * Build a Gym-compatible MuJoCo environment for Kurma.  
   * Craft rewards for speed, stability, and energy use.  
   * Train a continuous-action neural policy using Proximal Policy Optimization.  

2. **Imitation / Inverse RL (stretch)**  
   * Script or joystick-teleop a stable gait.  
   * Use Inverse RL to learn a reward that reproduces the demonstration, then refine with PPO.  

Deploy the final network to a Raspberry Pi controller, drive affordable servos, and film an untethered demo of Kurma on the move.
