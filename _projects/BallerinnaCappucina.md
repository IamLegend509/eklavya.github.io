### Project Description

Ballerina Cappucina, a graceful omnidirectional robot with a critical mission. In this project, you will bring her to life by designing and building a robot that can autonomously glide across a "dance floor," identify scattered colorful "bombs" (balls), and scoop them up with precision.<br>
You will be responsible for designing the complete system, from the custom omnidirectional mobile base that allows for fluid movement, to vision system using OpenCV for color detection. By implementing PID control, you will ensure the robot navigates smoothly and accurately. The final challenge is to integrate these systems, enabling Ballerina Cappucina to autonomously seek, collect, and sort the objects, clearing the stage.
