## Holoboard Mission Brief

Design and assemble a PCB fit for the Rebel Alliance's signal command unit — engineered using KiCad.

### The Mission Objective:

Craft a Holoboard (**PCB**) that performs the following core functions within the realm of analog circuitry:

- **Bandpass Filter Module:** Filters transmissions between **100 Hz and 500 Hz** — allowing only the desired frequencies to pass through the Force-field.  
- **Amplification Core:** Amplifies incoming signals with a total gain factor of **6x** — boosting weak transmissions from outer sectors.  
- **Threshold Detection Unit (Comparator):** Identifies signals exceeding **6V** and activates a **Status Beacon (LED)** — signaling the presence of high-power waves.

### System Requirements from the Jedi Council:

- **Input Signal Source:** A sine wave from a rebel transmitter, with a peak amplitude of **up to 2V**. Provide a **screw terminal** labeled `"INPUT"` for mission-critical interfacing.  
- **Power Protocols:** Deploy **±12V power rails** through dedicated **screw terminals** — one for the filter, another for the comparator. Keep their paths clear of interference.  
- **Board Constraints:** The holoboard must fit within the confines of **100mm × 80mm** — suitable for starfighter compartments.  
- **Assembly Considerations:** All components must be **suitable for hand-soldering by field engineers** (no droid-assisted assembly required).  
- **Labeling & Grounding:** Ensure all signals are **clearly marked via silkscreen**, and grounding follows **Imperial safety protocols** — preventing interference from the Dark Side (noise).

### High Council’s Design Commandment

**The simpler the routes, the more the marks — and the smaller the PCB, the more the marks.**  
Let this guiding principle shape your layout, your traces, and your component placement.

Let the electrons flow through your design, young Padawan. And remember — **with great layout comes great signal integrity**.
