## Task Description in Detail

- Design a **compound gear train** in **Onshape**.
- Achieve a **300:1 exact reduction ratio**.
- Use **exactly 6 gears** in your design.

## Expected Outcome

- **Onshape design file** (Link to the File with edit Access)
- **Animated GIF** of the working mechanism

## Hint from the Jedi Archives

- Use [**Gear Mate Relation**](https://youtu.be/X-Qk3VlCDPo?si=0-PTgs1zXl2yJ8_o) to simulate real gear interactions in Onshape
- Reference the holocron: [**Onshape How To: Gears**](https://youtu.be/AxCgO_eJocc?t=69&si=NTprczF3A7NA3KH1)

**May your designs mesh perfectly, and your ratios be exact.**

**May the CAD be with you.**
