## Transmission Blueprint Protocol – Eklavya Mission

- Rename your holocron (document) to the format:  
  `Eklavya_<Team Name>_<Team Number>`

- Grant editing access to the Jedi Council members:  
  hssagare_b23@el.vjti.ac.in  
  vvnigudkar_b23@el.vjti.ac.in  
  Do this once your design is ready for review and inform your mentor.

- Blueprint requirements:
  - Label all key components clearly:
    - Input Gear
    - Output Gear
    - Input Shaft
    - Output Shaft
  - Include a marker to track revolutions.
  - Ensure the design is clear and easy to evaluate.

> Clarity, precision, and compact design will lead your squad to triumph.

## Expected Outcome

- **Onshape design file** (Link to the File with edit Access)
- **Animated GIF** of the working mechanism

## Hint from the Jedi Archives

- Use [**Gear Mate Relation**](https://youtu.be/X-Qk3VlCDPo?si=0-PTgs1zXl2yJ8_o) to simulate real gear interactions in Onshape
- Reference the holocron: [**Onshape How To: Gears**](https://youtu.be/AxCgO_eJocc?t=69&si=NTprczF3A7NA3KH1)

**May your designs mesh perfectly, and your ratios be exact.**

**May the CAD be with you.**
